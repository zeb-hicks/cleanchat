# ![icon](icon32.png) Clean Chat for Twitch

Extension for making Twitch chat suck a little less.

Reduces clutter by hiding all the badges and timestamp and shows them on hover instead.

Also enlarges emotes in messages with no text and 1-3 emotes, similar to the behaviour of other modern chat apps like Discord.
